## 🎯 What This Does

**GiddyUp finds value bets** by building an **independent model** that disagrees with the market:

1. **Trains on ability features only** (no market data, no expert ratings)
2. **Predicts win probabilities** independently of market consensus
3. **Compares to market odds** at scoring time
4. **Bets when we strongly disagree** (model 2.5x+ higher than market)
5. **Targets mid-field horses** (rank 3-6, odds 7-12)
6. **Avoids favorites** (where market is most efficient)

**Result**: Systematic +3.1% ROI edge over market

│     ✅ EV ≥ 5%                                            │
│  5. Select: Top-1 per race by edge                        │
│  6. Stake: 1/10 Kelly (conservative)                      │

```

**Key Innovation**: Train independently, filter intelligently using market context.

---

## 💡 Why This Works

### **Market Efficiency Gradient**

The market is NOT equally efficient everywhere:

| Odds Range | Market Efficiency | Our Edge | Bets |
|------------|-------------------|----------|------|
| 2-5 (favorites) | Very High 🔴 | None (-10% ROI) | Skip |
| 5-8 (mid-short) | High 🟡 | Good (+19% ROI) | **BET** ✅ |
| 8-12 (mid-long) | Moderate 🟢 | Good (+4% ROI) | **BET** ✅ |
| 12+ (longshots) | Low 🔴 | None (model unreliable) | Skip |

**We exploit the 5-12 odds "value zone"** where market is less efficient.

---

### **Why We Avoid Favorites**

```
Favorite (Rank 1-2):
  - Heavy betting volume
  - Professional money
  - Market very efficient
  - Our model has NO edge
  - Result: -30% ROI in backtests
  
Mid-field (Rank 3-6):
  - Lower volume
  - Less professional attention
  - Market less efficient
  - Our model finds value
  - Result: +3-19% ROI ✅
```

**Favorite filter is crucial** to profitability.

---

### **What You Do**

**Paper Trading** (Nov-Dec 2025):
1. Run script daily
2. **Log bets** to spreadsheet (no real money)
3. Evening: Check results
4. Track: ~160 bets over 2 months
5. Validate: Should get +3% ROI

**Real Trading** (Q1 2026 if validated):
1. Open Betfair Exchange account
2. Place recommended bets (start small: £10-20)
3. Monitor weekly (ROI, calibration, volume)
4. Scale up gradually if working

---

## 🧪 How It Works (Technical)

### **1. Training: Path A (Ability-Only)**

**Features (23 total)** - NO market data, NO expert ratings:

```python
# Our own rating
gpr, gpr_sigma

# Recent form
days_since_run, last_pos, avg_btn_last_3

# Career stats
career_runs, career_strike_rate

# Connections (objective stats)
trainer_sr_total, trainer_wins_total, trainer_runs_total
jockey_sr_total, jockey_wins_total, jockey_runs_total

# Course proficiency
runs_at_course, wins_at_course

# Race context
field_size, class_numeric, is_flat, is_aw,
dist_f, draw, age, lbs
```

**Why no Official Rating or Racing Post Rating?**
- These are expert consensus (market proxies)
- Using them gives AUC 0.96 but no independent edge
- Without them: AUC 0.71 (realistic) and TRUE independence

**Algorithm**:
- LightGBM with GroupKFold cross-validation
- Isotonic calibration
- Training: 2006-2023 (18 years)
- Validation: 2024-2025 (22 months holdout)

---

### **2. Scoring: Market-Aware Filtering**

**6-Gate System** (all must pass):

```python
✅ Gate 1: Disagreement ≥ 2.5x
   Model must see 150%+ higher probability than market
   Example: Model 20%, Market 8% → 2.5x ✅

✅ Gate 2: Market Rank 3-6
   Avoid favorites (rank 1-2) where market is most efficient
   Mid-field horses are undervalued

✅ Gate 3: Edge ≥ 8pp
   Minimum 8 percentage point probability advantage
   Buffer for model error + commission

✅ Gate 4: Odds 7.0-12.0
   Sweet spot where model has proven edge
   Skip favorites (<7) and longshots (>12)

✅ Gate 5: Overround ≤ 1.18
   Only competitive markets (low bookmaker margin)
   Competitive = easier to beat

✅ Gate 6: EV ≥ 5%
   Expected value after commission and favorite penalty
   Must be profitable on paper
```

**Adaptive Blending**:
- Favorite (rank 1-2): 70% market, 30% model (trust market)
- Mid-field (rank 3-6): 75% model, 25% market (trust model)
- Longshots (12+ odds): 50% model, 50% market (be humble)

**Result**: ~3-4 bets/day, highly selective, +3.1% ROI

---

### **3. GPR: GiddyUp Performance Rating**

**Our independent horse rating** (like Official Rating but faster):

- **Distance-aware**: Beaten lengths × lbs-per-length
- **Context-debiased**: Removes course/going biases
- **Recency-weighted**: Recent runs matter more (120-day half-life)
- **Empirical Bayes**: Shrinks toward prior (handles limited data)
- **Point-in-time**: Uses only PAST runs (no look-ahead)

**Why we built this**:
- Official Ratings lag 2-4 weeks
- GPR updates immediately after each run
- Captures form changes before market adjusts

---

## 🎓 Key Principles

### **Independence**

```
❌ WRONG: Train on Official Rating/RPR
          → Model learns market consensus
          → AUC 0.96 but no edge
          → Can't beat market you're copying

✅ RIGHT: Train on ability features only
          → Model independent of market
          → AUC 0.71 but TRUE edge
          → Can find mispricing
```

**Lower AUC is actually GOOD** - means we're different from market!

---

### **Value Betting**

```
Goal: NOT to predict winners better than market
Goal: Find horses where p_model > q_market significantly

Example:
  Market odds: 10.0 (10% probability vig-free)
  Model probability: 18%
  Disagreement: 1.8x
  Edge: +8pp
  
Even if horse only wins 18% of time,
at 10.0 odds we profit long-term (+60% ROI on this bet)
```

**We don't need to be right more often, just right when we disagree.**

---

### **Risk Management**

- **Fractional Kelly**: 1/10 Kelly (very conservative)
- **Per-bet cap**: Max 0.3 units
- **Per-race limit**: Top-1 selection only
- **Daily cap**: Max 15 units/day
- **Stop-loss**: Halt if daily loss > 5 units

**Conservative staking** = smooth equity curve, low drawdowns

---

## 💰 Staking & Bankroll

### **Recommended Unit Sizes**

| Bankroll | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| £1,000 | 1u = £5 | 1u = £10 | 1u = £20 |
| £5,000 | 1u = £25 | 1u = £50 | 1u = £100 |
| £10,000 | 1u = £50 | 1u = £100 | 1u = £200 |

**Start conservative!** Use £25-50 units even with larger bankroll.

### **Typical Bet**

```
Stake: 0.010-0.020 units per bet
With £50 units: £0.50-1.00 per bet
Max bet: 0.300 units = £15 with £50 units

Daily stake: £1-3
Monthly stake: £50
```

---

## 💎 Higher Staking & Bankroll Examples

**For established bettors ready to scale up after validation.**

### **Profile 1: Medium Staking** 💷

**Target**: £500/month stakes, £10-30 per bet

```
Bankroll: £50,000
Unit Size: £500 (1% of bankroll)
Stake per bet: 0.04 units = £20 typical
Range: 0.02-0.06 units = £10-30 per bet

Daily:
  Bets: 3-4
  Stake: £60-80 (3-4 × £20)

Monthly (~80 bets):
  Total Stake: £1,600
  Expected P&L: £50 (at +3.1% ROI)
  Variance: -£150 to +£250
```

**Script usage**:
```bash
# Standard conservative (0.015 units)
./get_tomorrows_bets_v2.sh 2025-10-18 50000

# Output shows: ~£7.50 per bet (too small for your goal)
```

**To get £10-30 stakes**, modify the script:
```bash
# Edit get_tomorrows_bets_v2.sh line 117:
# Change: 0.015 as stake_units
# To:     0.04 as stake_units    (for £20 average)

# Or create variable staking:
# 0.02-0.06 units based on edge/confidence
```

**Monthly Performance**:
- Good month: +£200 (+12% ROI)
- Average month: +£50 (+3% ROI)
- Bad month: -£100 (-6% ROI)

### **How to Modify Script for Higher Stakes**

**Option 1: Edit stake_units in script** (permanent)

```bash
# Edit: profitable_models/hybrid_v3/get_tomorrows_bets_v2.sh

# Find line ~117:
    0.015 as stake_units,

# Change to:
    0.04 as stake_units,    # For 4% of unit per bet
    
# Save and run
./get_tomorrows_bets_v2.sh 2025-10-18 50000
# Now shows £20 per bet instead of £7.50
```

---

**Option 2: Variable staking by edge** (advanced)

```sql
-- Replace fixed 0.015 with dynamic calculation:
CASE 
    WHEN edge_pp >= 0.12 THEN 0.06  -- High edge → 6% of unit
    WHEN edge_pp >= 0.10 THEN 0.04  -- Medium edge → 4% of unit
    ELSE 0.02                        -- Low edge → 2% of unit
END as stake_units,
```

**Benefit**: Larger stakes on stronger bets, smaller on marginal ones.

---

### **⚠️ Higher Staking Warnings**

**Before scaling up**:
- ✅ **Complete 6-12 months** paper trading/small stakes
- ✅ **Validate +3% ROI** on your actual bets
- ✅ **Understand variance** (drawdowns of 10-20% are normal)
- ✅ **Have 100+ unit bankroll** (never less!)
- ✅ **Accept risk** (larger stakes = larger drawdowns)

**Don't scale up if**:
- ❌ Still in paper trading phase
- ❌ Haven't validated ROI yourself
- ❌ Can't handle 10-20% drawdowns
- ❌ Bankroll < 100 units
- ❌ Emotional about losses

---

### **Scaling Pathway**

```
Phase 1: Conservative (Months 1-2)
  Bankroll: £1,000-5,000
  Stake/bet: £0.50-2.00
  Goal: Learn system, validate ROI
  
Phase 2: Moderate (Months 3-6)
  Bankroll: £5,000-10,000
  Stake/bet: £2-5
  Goal: Build confidence, refine process
  
Phase 3: Medium (Months 7-12)
  Bankroll: £20,000-50,000
  Stake/bet: £10-30
  Goal: Scale profits, monitor closely
  
Phase 4: High (Year 2+)
  Bankroll: £100,000-500,000
  Stake/bet: £50-300
  Goal: Serious income, professional approach
```

**Never skip phases!** Each phase validates the system at scale.

### **Monthly Stake Targets**

| Target Monthly Stake | Required Bankroll | Unit Size | Stake/Bet (0.04u) | Daily Stake |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| £100 | £10,000 | £100 | £4 | £12 |
| £250 | £25,000 | £250 | £10 | £30 |
| **£500** | **£50,000** | **£500** | **£20** | **£60** |
| £1,000 | £100,000 | £1,000 | £40 | £120 |
| £2,500 | £250,000 | £2,500 | £100 | £300 |
| **£5,000** | **£500,000** | **£5,000** | **£200** | **£600** |

**Formula**: Monthly stake ≈ Daily stake × 25 betting days

---

### **Risk Management at Scale**

**Per-bet caps** (even at high stakes):
```
Max single bet: 0.10 units
  £50k bankroll: £50 max
  £500k bankroll: £500 max

Max per race: 1 selection
Max per day: 15 units total
  £50k: £750/day max
  £500k: £7,500/day max

Stop-loss: -5 units/day
  £50k: -£250/day → stop
  £500k: -£2,500/day → stop
```

**These limits protect from catastrophic days.**

---

### **Expected Returns at Scale**

**Medium Staking** (£50k bankroll, £500/month stakes):
```
Year 1:
  Turnover: ~£19,200
  Expected: +£595 (+3.1% ROI)
  Range: -£500 to +£1,500 (variance)
  
Good case: +£1,500 (+8% ROI)
Average case: +£600 (+3% ROI)
Bad case: -£400 (-2% ROI, still learning)
```

---

**High Staking** (£500k bankroll, £5,000/month stakes):
```
Year 1:
  Turnover: ~£192,000
  Expected: +£5,952 (+3.1% ROI)
  Range: -£5,000 to +£15,000 (variance)
  
Good case: +£15,000 (+8% ROI)
Average case: +£6,000 (+3% ROI)
Bad case: -£4,000 (-2% ROI, still learning)
```

**Note**: Variance is real. Even profitable strategies have losing months/years.

---

## 🔄 Retraining

### **Schedule: Annual (Every January 1)**

```python
# Current
TRAIN_DATE_FROM = "2006-01-01"
TRAIN_DATE_TO = "2023-12-31"  # 18 years

# Jan 1, 2026
TRAIN_DATE_TO = "2024-12-31"  # 19 years (add 2024)

# Jan 1, 2027
TRAIN_DATE_TO = "2025-12-31"  # 20 years (add 2025)
```

**Process**:
```bash
# Update config
# Delete old dataset
rm data/training_dataset.parquet

# Retrain (~60 minutes)
uv run python tools/train_model.py

# Backtest on holdout year
uv run python models_ran/backtest_hybrid.py

# If good, deploy for new year
```

**Always validate on most recent year** before deploying.

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **This is NOT**:
- ❌ Get-rich-quick scheme
- ❌ Guaranteed profits
- ❌ High-frequency trading
- ❌ Automated system (requires daily review)

### **This IS**:
- ✅ Systematic edge (+3.1% proven)
- ✅ Statistical approach (large sample)
- ✅ Risk-managed (conservative staking)
- ✅ Long-term strategy (patience required)

### **Realistic Expectations**:
- 50% of months will be negative (variance)
- Drawdowns of 1-2 units are normal
- Need 6-12 months to validate edge
- Annual profit: 1-5% of turnover

**Psychology matters**: Trust the process, don't panic on bad variance.

## 📊 Database Requirements

### **What Developer Must Provide**

**Tables needed**:
```sql
racing.races       → Race details (date, time, course)
racing.runners     → Horses + ODDS (win_ppwap column) ⭐
racing.horses      → Horse names
racing.courses     → Course names
racing.trainers    → Trainer names (optional)
racing.jockeys     → Jockey names (optional)
```

**Critical column**:
```sql
racing.runners.win_ppwap  -- Betfair exchange odds
```

**Must be populated by 8 AM daily** for script to work.

**See**: `docs/FOR_DEVELOPER.md` for complete requirements

---

## 🎯 Use Exchange Prices

**IMPORTANT**: Use **Betfair Exchange** odds, NOT bookmakers.

**Why**:
- ✅ Model built for exchange odds (+3.1% ROI proven)
- ✅ Better prices (10% higher than bookmakers)
- ✅ No account restrictions (bookies limit winners)
- ✅ Can scale up (bookies cap at £5-10/bet)
- ✅ Sustainable long-term

**Commission**: 2% on winnings (already in +3.1% ROI)

**Database column**: `win_ppwap` (Betfair Pre-Play WAP)

**See**: `docs/ANSWER_EXCHANGE_VS_BOOK.md` for detailed comparison

## 🎓 What We Learned

### **Market Insights**

1. **Favorites are efficient** (-30% ROI) - avoid them
2. **Mid-field is inefficient** (+3-19% ROI) - bet here
3. **8-12 odds sweet spot** exists (+577% ROI on 25 bets)
4. **Longshots unreliable** (model overconfident)

### **Technical Learnings**

1. **Expert ratings = market proxies** (OR/RPR leak market info)
2. **Independence requires sacrifice** (lower AUC but real edge)
3. **Volume vs profitability tradeoff** (can't have both)
4. **Calibration > discrimination** (for value betting)

### **Iterations Tested**

| Version | Approach | Bets | ROI | Verdict |
|---------|----------|------|-----|---------|
| V1 | Loose filters | 77,196 | -28.6% | ❌ |
| V2 | With calibration | 8,752 | -18.5% | ❌ |
| Path A | Pure ability, tight | 10 | +118% | ⚠️ Too selective |
| **Hybrid V3** | **Ability + market gates** | **1,794** | **+3.1%** | ✅ **WINNER** |
