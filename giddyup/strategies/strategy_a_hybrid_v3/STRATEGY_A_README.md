## 🎯 **What This Strategy Does**

**Hybrid V3** finds value by targeting **mid-field horses (rank 3-6)** that the market undervalues:

### **6-Gate Selection System**:

1. ✅ **Disagreement ≥ 2.5x** (model sees 150%+ more chance)
2. ✅ **Market Rank 3-6** (avoid over-bet favorites)
3. ✅ **Edge ≥ 8pp** (minimum 8 percentage point advantage)
4. ✅ **Odds 7-12** (sweet spot range)
5. ✅ **Overround ≤ 118%** (competitive markets only)
6. ✅ **EV ≥ 5%** (after commission)

**Focus**: Rank-based selection (mid-field horses)
