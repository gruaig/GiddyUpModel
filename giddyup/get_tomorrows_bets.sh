-- This query applies all 6 gates:
--   1. Odds range: 7-12 (sweet spot)
--   2. Market rank: 3-6 (avoid favorites)
--   3. Overround: ‚â§1.18 (competitive market)
--   4. Disagreement: ‚â•2.5x (model much higher than market)
--   5. Edge: ‚â•8pp minimum
--   6. EV: ‚â•5% after commission
--
-- Tables touched:
--   - racing.races (race details, off_time, course)
--   - racing.runners (horses in race, odds)
--   - racing.courses (course names)
--   - racing.horses (horse names)
