## üìä **What Information the Model Needs**

### **Minimum Required** (From Database):

#### **A. Race Information**
- `race_id`
- `race_date`  
- `off_time`
- `course_name`
- `class`
- `dist_f` (distance in furlongs)
- `going`
- `ran` (field size)

#### **B. Runner Information**
- `horse_id`
- `horse_name`
- `trainer_id`
- `jockey_id`
- `draw` (stall position)
- `age`
- `lbs` (weight)

#### **C. Market Odds** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
- `decimal_odds` (from `win_ppwap` or `dec`)

**Without odds, we cannot score!**

---

### **Optional (Improves Accuracy)**:
- Historical runs for GPR calculation
- Trainer/jockey stats
- Course form
- Recent form

**But for QUICK selections**, just need race + runner + **odds**.

---

## üöÄ **Simplified Daily Process**

### **Every Morning at 8 AM**:

**Step 1: Check if odds are available**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM racing.runners 
WHERE race_id IN (
    SELECT race_id FROM racing.races WHERE race_date = CURRENT_DATE
)
AND (win_ppwap IS NOT NULL OR dec IS NOT NULL);
```

**If count > 0**: ‚úÖ Odds available, proceed to Step 2  
**If count = 0**: ‚è≥ Wait, odds not loaded yet

---

**Step 2: Run scoring**
```bash
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUpModel/giddyup
uv run python tools/score_today_simple.py --date 2025-10-18
```

---

**Step 3: Review selections**

Script outputs:
```
üéØ BET RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 2025-10-18

BET #1
   14:30 Ascot
   Horse: Thunder Road (#5)
   Odds: 9.50 | Rank: 4
   
   Model: 17.2% | Market: 10.5%
   Disagreement: 1.64x | Edge: 6.7pp
   
   üí∞ BET: 0.015 units @ 9.50 (¬£0.75 with ¬£50 units)

[More bets...]

Total: 2-4 bets
```

---

**Step 4: Place bets** (During paper trading: just LOG them)

---

**Step 5: Evening - Check results**

```sql
SELECT horse_id, pos_num 
FROM racing.runners
WHERE race_id IN (your_bet_race_ids);
```

Update your tracking:
- Did horse win (pos_num = 1)?
- Calculate P&L
- Update spreadsheet

---

## üìù **What to Create Today (Oct 17)**

### **1. Tracking Spreadsheet**

Create a Google Sheet or Excel with columns:
```
| Date | Time | Course | Horse | Odds | Rank | Stake | Result | P&L |
|------|------|--------|-------|------|------|-------|--------|-----|
```

---

### **2. Database Query to Check Odds Availability**

Save this query:
```sql
-- Run this each morning to see if odds are ready
SELECT 
    race_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT race_id) as races,
    COUNT(*) as total_runners,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL OR dec IS NOT NULL) as runners_with_odds,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL OR dec IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*)::numeric, 1) as pct_with_odds
FROM racing.runners ru
JOIN racing.races r USING (race_id)
WHERE r.race_date = CURRENT_DATE  -- Or '2025-10-18'
GROUP BY race_date;
```

When `pct_with_odds` > 80%, you're ready to score!

---

### **3. Set Reminder for Tomorrow Morning**

```
8:00 AM Oct 18:
  1. Check if odds loaded (run query above)
  2. If yes: Run scoring script
  3. Review selections
  4. Log to spreadsheet
```
