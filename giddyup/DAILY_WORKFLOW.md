# Daily Workflow: Getting Tomorrow's Bets

**Simple guide for Oct 18, 2025 and every day after**

---

## ‚è∞ **Timeline**

### **Tonight (Oct 17, Evening)** - NOT READY YET
- Races exist for Oct 18 ‚úÖ
- Runners partially loaded ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Odds NOT available** ‚ùå
- **Cannot score yet**

### **Tomorrow Morning (Oct 18, 8:00 AM)** - READY TO SCORE
- Odds will be populated ‚úÖ
- Run scoring query
- Get 0-5 bet recommendations

---

## üìã **Step-by-Step for Tomorrow Morning**

### **Step 1: Check if Odds are Ready** (8:00 AM Oct 18)

```bash
docker exec horse_racing psql -U postgres -d horse_db -c "
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_runners,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL OR dec IS NOT NULL) as with_odds,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL OR dec IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*)::numeric, 0) as pct
FROM racing.runners ru
JOIN racing.races r USING (race_id)
WHERE r.race_date = '2025-10-18';
"
```

**Expected output**:
```
 total_runners | with_odds | pct 
---------------|-----------|-----
      450     |    420    | 93
```

**If `pct` > 80%**: ‚úÖ Ready to score  
**If `pct` < 50%**: ‚è≥ Wait 1-2 hours, odds still loading

### **Step 2: Get Qualifying Horses** (Once Odds Ready)

```bash
docker exec horse_racing psql -U postgres -d horse_db -c "
-- HYBRID V3 SELECTION QUERY
-- This finds horses matching all 6 gates

    AND edge_pp >= 0.08                           -- Gate 5: 8pp minimum edge
    AND p_model * (decimal_odds - 1) * 0.98 - (1 - p_model) >= 0.05  -- Gate 6: 5% EV

best_per_race AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY race_id ORDER BY edge_pp DESC) as rank_in_race
    FROM filtered

SELECT

## üéØ **What Each Column Means**

| Column | Meaning | Selection Criteria |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `market_prob` | What market thinks | 8-10% typical |

## üìä **Information Sources from Your Database**

### **Tables Used**:
```
racing.races        ‚Üí Race details (date, time, course)
racing.runners      ‚Üí Horses in race + ODDS
racing.horses       ‚Üí Horse names
racing.courses      ‚Üí Course names
```

### **Critical Columns**:
```
win_ppwap           ‚Üí Betfair WAP odds (preferred)
dec                 ‚Üí Decimal odds (fallback)
```

**At least ONE of these must be populated!**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **If Odds Not Available Tomorrow Morning**

**Option A**: Wait until later (10 AM, 12 PM)
- Odds might load throughout morning
- Re-run query every hour

**Option B**: Manual entry
- Get odds from Betfair/Oddschecker
- Manually calculate which horses qualify
- Use spreadsheet

**Option C**: Use evening before odds
- Some bookies publish overnight prices
- Less accurate but works for testing

---

## ‚úÖ **Your Checklist for Tomorrow**

**Tonight (Oct 17)**:
- [ ] Nothing to do (odds not ready)
- [ ] Create tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Set 8 AM alarm for tomorrow

**Tomorrow Morning (Oct 18, 8:00 AM)**:
- [ ] Check if odds loaded (run Step 1 query)
- [ ] If yes: Run Step 2 query (get selections)
- [ ] Log any bets to spreadsheet
- [ ] Set reminders to check results

**Tomorrow Evening (Oct 18)**:
- [ ] Check which horses won
- [ ] Update P&L
- [ ] Compare to predictions

---

## üöÄ **Starting Nov 1** (Systematic)

Once you've tested a few days:

1. **Save the SQL query** as a script
2. **Run it daily** at 8 AM
3. **Automate** (cron job or manual routine)
4. **Track everything** in spreadsheet
5. **Review weekly** (bets, ROI, patterns)

---

**TL;DR for Tomorrow**:
- ‚è≥ **Wait until 8 AM Oct 18** (odds not ready yet)
- üîç **Run selection query** (SQL provided above)
- üìù **Log 0-3 bets** (probably 1-2)
- ‚úÖ **Check results tomorrow evening**

**That's it!** Simple daily routine. üéØ
