- Point-in-time calculation (no look-ahead bias)
- Distance-aware, context-debiased, recency-weighted
- Comparable to Official Rating scale

### **2. Data Leakage Prevention**

- Year-by-year GPR computation
- GroupKFold cross-validation
- Pure holdout testing (2024-2025)

### **3. Dual Strategy Approach**
- Hybrid V3: Proven conservative (+3%)
- Path B: High-ROI aggressive (+65%)
- Portfolio approach: Best of both worlds

### **4. Banded Optimization**
- Different thresholds per odds range
- Odds-band specific lambda blending
- Optimized through systematic iteration
- 21x ROI improvement over baseline

---

## 🎓 **What You Learned**

### **Market Insights**:
1. Favorites are efficient (-30% ROI) → Avoid
2. Mid-field less efficient (+3-65% ROI) → Target
3. Market efficiency varies by odds/rank
4. Independence > copying market

### **Technical Insights**:
1. Expert ratings (OR/RPR) are market proxies
2. Lower AUC can mean better (independence!)
3. Banded approach > one-size-fits-all
4. Volume/ROI tradeoff is real

### **Practical Insights**:
1. Exchange > bookmaker (despite 2% commission)
2. T-60 timing is optimal (matches model calibration)
3. Morning prices are traps (not calibrated)
4. Can run multiple strategies for diversification

---

## 🚀 **Ready for Tomorrow**

### **What to Do** (Oct 18, 8 AM):

```bash
# Go to scripts location
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUpModel/giddyup/profitable_models/hybrid_v3

# Run selection script with YOUR bankroll
./get_tomorrows_bets_with_reasoning.sh 2025-10-18 5000

# You'll see:
# - 3-4 bet selections
# - Detailed reasoning for each (WHY bet)
# - Real £ stakes (based on your £5,000 bankroll)
# - Auto-generated CSV (import to spreadsheet)
# - What to check at T-60

# Then at T-60 before each race:
# - Check current Betfair odds
# - If odds >= minimum → Place bet
# - If odds < minimum → Skip (edge gone)

# Evening:
# - Update spreadsheet with results
# - Calculate P&L
# - Track progress
```

**Start with paper trading** (no real money until validated!)
