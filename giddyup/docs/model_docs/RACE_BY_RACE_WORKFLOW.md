# 🏇 Race-by-Race Betting Workflow

**Your Concern**: "Races all over the day, 10am races not priced at 8am"

**Answer**: You're absolutely right! Here's how to handle races throughout the day.

---

## ⏰ The Problem with "8 AM Once"

### **Why 8 AM Script Run Isn't Enough**

```
Racing Schedule Today:
  10:15 - Wolverhampton
  11:30 - Kempton
  12:45 - Ascot
  14:00 - Newmarket
  15:30 - York
  17:00 - Leopardstown
  18:45 - Dundalk

If you run script at 8:00 AM:
  ❌ 10:15 race: T-60 is 9:15 (1h 15m away - prices not stable yet!)
  ❌ 11:30 race: T-60 is 10:30 (2h 30m away - prices not ready)
  ✅ 14:00 race: T-60 is 13:00 (5h away - prices available)
  ✅ Later races: Prices available
```

**Early races are too close to 8 AM for stable pricing.**

---

## ✅ Solution: Race-by-Race Approach

**Don't run once at 8 AM and bet all races**

**Instead: Check each race ~90 minutes before its off time**

---

## 📋 Correct Workflow

### **Option A: Manual Race-by-Race** (Recommended for Starting)

**Throughout the day, for each race**:

```bash
# 90-60 minutes before each race, run script
./get_tomorrows_bets_v2.sh 2025-10-18 50000
```

**Timeline example**:

```
Target Race: 10:15 Wolverhampton
├─ 09:00 (T-75): Check if selection exists
├─ 09:15 (T-60): Bet window opens ✅
├─ 09:30 (T-45): Bet window still good ✅
└─ 09:45 (T-30): Bet window closing ⚠️

Target Race: 14:00 Newmarket  
├─ 12:45 (T-75): Check if selection exists
├─ 13:00 (T-60): Bet window opens ✅
├─ 13:15 (T-45): Bet window still good ✅
└─ 13:30 (T-30): Bet window closing ⚠️
```

**For each race**:
1. Check script 60-90 min before off
2. Review selection (if any)
3. Check current Betfair odds
4. Bet if odds ≥ minimum

---

### **Option B: All-Day Script** (Advanced)

**Modified script that checks continuously**:

```bash
# Run once, shows ALL races with bet windows
./get_all_races_with_timing.sh 2025-10-18 50000
```

**Output**:
```

```

---

### **Option C: Split Approach** (Best Balance)

**Morning (8:00 AM)**: Preview afternoon/evening races only
```bash
# Shows races from 14:00 onwards
./get_tomorrows_bets_v2.sh 2025-10-18 50000 --after 14:00
```

**Then for each race group**:
- **Early races (10am-12pm)**: Check at 9am-11am
- **Afternoon races (2pm-4pm)**: Already previewed at 8am
- **Evening races (5pm-7pm)**: Already previewed at 8am

```

---

## 🔔 Alert System Recommendation

### **Set Phone Alerts**

**After 8 AM script run**:
```
9:00  - Check early races (if any before 12pm)
11:45 - Bet window (12:45 race)
13:00 - Bet window (14:00 race)
14:30 - Bet window (15:30 race)
16:00 - Bet window (17:00 race)
17:45 - Bet window (18:45 race)
```

**Or simpler**: Set alert **T-60 for each race**

---

## 📱 Mobile App Workflow

### **Best Practice: Betfair Mobile App**

**Advantage**: Can bet anywhere, don't need to be at computer all day

**Workflow**:
1. **8:00 AM** - Run script on laptop, note races/horses/minimums
2. **Throughout day** - Use Betfair app to check odds & bet
3. **Each T-60** - Open app, find race, check odds, bet if good

**Example**:
```
8 AM on laptop:
  Note: 14:00 Newmarket - Silver Storm @ 10.0 minimum
  
1 PM on phone (anywhere):
  Open Betfair app
  Find: Newmarket 14:00 race
  Check: Silver Storm current odds = 10.8 ✅
  Bet: £18 @ 10.8
  Log: Text yourself or note for evening spreadsheet update
```

---

## 🤖 Automated Solution (Advanced)

### **For Serious Bettors**: Auto-Monitor Script

```bash
# Run continuously throughout the day
./monitor_all_day.sh 2025-10-18 50000

# Checks database every 15 minutes
# Sends notifications when bet windows open
# Can even auto-place bets (if configured)
```

**How it works**:
```
08:00 - Script starts, checks all races
08:15 - Re-check (update prices)
08:30 - Re-check
08:45 - Re-check
09:00 - Alert: "10:15 race bet window open"
09:15 - Alert: "Place bet: Fast Lane @ 8.2"
...continues all day
```

**Requires**:
- Script running on server/laptop all day
- Betfair API access (for auto-betting)
- More complex setup

**For starting: Manual approach is fine** ✅

---

## 📊 Race Timing Distribution

### **Typical UK/IRE Racing Day**

```
🌅 MORNING SLOTS (10:00 - 12:00)
├─ Usually: 2-4 races
├─ Tracks: All-weather (Wolverhampton, Kempton, Dundalk)
└─ Check at: 9:00 AM for these

☀️ AFTERNOON SLOTS (12:00 - 16:00)  ⭐ MAIN CARD
├─ Usually: 6-10 races
├─ Tracks: Major turf (Ascot, Newmarket, York, etc.)
└─ Can check at: 8:00 AM (ready by then)

🌙 EVENING SLOTS (16:00 - 20:00)
├─ Usually: 3-6 races
├─ Tracks: All-weather + some turf
└─ Can check at: 8:00 AM (ready by then)
```

**Your 8 AM script run will capture 70-80% of races** (afternoon/evening)

**Do a 9-10 AM check for the remaining early races**

Throughout day - Bet at each T-60
Evening - Update spreadsheet

Include: All races, manual checks
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Don't run once at 8 AM and bet everything** ❌
   - Early races (10am-12pm) won't have stable prices yet

2. **Check throughout the day** ✅
   - 9 AM for early races
   - Lunch for afternoon races  
   - Evening for late races

3. **Or focus on main card only** ✅ (easiest)
   - 12:00-16:00 races (60% of value)
   - Check at lunch, bet all at once
   - Much simpler, less time commitment

4. **Mobile betting is your friend** 📱
   - Betfair app lets you bet anywhere
   - Check script in morning, bet on phone during day

5. **You don't need every race** ✅
   - 3-4 bets/day average
   - Missing morning races = miss ~1 bet/day
   - Focus on quality > quantity

---

## 🚀 Start Simple, Scale Up

### **Week 1-2: Afternoon Only**
- Check at noon
- Bet on 12:00-16:00 races only
- Learn the process

### **Week 3-4: Add Evening**
- Add evening check
- Now covering 12:00-20:00 (80% of racing)

### **Month 2+: Add Morning**
- Add 9 AM check
- Now covering all races (100%)

**Don't overcomplicate at start!** Afternoon races are enough to learn and profit.
