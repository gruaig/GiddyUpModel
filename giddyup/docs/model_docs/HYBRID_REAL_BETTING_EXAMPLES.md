```
Horse @ 8.0 odds, p_blend = 16%:
  Kelly full = 4.2%
  Stake = 0.42% of bankroll = 0.004 units

Horse @ 10.0 odds, p_blend = 18%:
  Kelly full = 5.8%
  Stake = 0.58% of bankroll = 0.006 units
  Typical bet: 0.006-0.020 units

Horse @ 12.0 odds, p_blend = 20%:
  Kelly full = 8.3%
  Stake = 0.83% of bankroll = 0.008 units
  Typical bet: 0.008-0.025 units
```

**Average stake**: ~0.013 units per bet

## 🎯 **How to Select Bets Going Forward**

### **Daily Scoring Process**

Create a script that runs every day:

```bash
# tools/score_tomorrow_hybrid.py

# 1. Get tomorrow's races
races = get_races_for_date("2025-10-18")

# 2. Build ability features
df = build_training_data("2025-10-18", "2025-10-18")

# 3. Load Path A model
model = load_model_from_mlflow()

# 4. Predict
p_model = model.predict(ability_features)

# 5. Get current market odds
market_odds = get_current_market_odds(races)

# 6. Apply hybrid gates
candidates = apply_hybrid_gates(df, p_model, market_odds)

# 7. Select top-1 per race
bets = select_top_per_race(candidates)

# 8. Publish signals to database
publish_signals(bets)

# 9. Send alert/email with bet recommendations
```

---

### **Bet Selection Criteria (What You'd Bet Tomorrow)**

For **each race tomorrow (Oct 18, 2025)**:

1. **Run model** on all horses → get `p_model`
2. **Get current odds** (T-60 or latest available)
3. **Calculate disagreement**: `p_model / q_vigfree`
4. **Apply 6 gates**:
   ```
   ✅ Model ≥ 2.5x higher than market
   ✅ Market rank 3-6 (not favorite/2nd fav)
   ✅ Edge ≥ 8pp
   ✅ Odds 7-12
   ✅ Overround ≤ 1.18
   ✅ EV ≥ 5%
   ```
5. **Select top-1** per race by edge
6. **Stake**: 1/10 Kelly, capped at 0.3u

---

### **Example for Tomorrow (Hypothetical)**

```
Race: Ascot 14:30, 10 runners

Model predictions:
  Horse A (favorite, 3.5 odds): p=25%, q=28% → No bet (rank 1)
  Horse B (2nd fav, 5.0 odds): p=18%, q=19% → No bet (rank 2)
  Horse C (4th, 9.0 odds): p=16%, q=11% → Disagreement 1.45x ❌ (< 2.5x)
  Horse D (5th, 10.0 odds): p=24%, q=9% → Disagreement 2.67x ✅
    Edge: 15pp ✅
    EV: +18% ✅
    Overround: 1.12 ✅
    All gates pass!
    
🎯 BET: Horse D @ 10.0 for 0.015 units
```

**You'd get 0-3 bets like this per day.**

## 🔄 **When to Retrain the Model**

### **Current Situation (October 2025)**

**Model trained on**: 2006-2023 (18 years)  
**Been running on**: 2024-2025 (22 months) - **BACKTEST ONLY**  
**2 months left in 2025**: Oct-Dec

---

### **Retraining Strategy - Option A: End of Year** ⭐

**Recommended approach**:

```
NOW (Oct 2025):
  - Deploy hybrid V3 for paper trading
  - Use existing model (trained on 2006-2023)
  - Track Nov-Dec 2025 results
  - Expect: ~160 bets over 2 months
  
January 1, 2026:
  - Retrain on 2006-2024 (add 2024 data)
  - Still hold out 2025 for validation
  - Deploy new model for 2026
  
January 1, 2027:
  - Retrain on 2006-2025
  - Hold out 2026 for validation
  - Continue annually
```

**Why annual retraining**:
- Horse racing patterns evolve slowly
- Need 15+ years of training data
- Annual refresh captures trends without overfitting
- Always validate on most recent year

---

### **Retraining Strategy - Option B: Quarterly Updates**

```
October 2025:
  - Retrain on 2006-2024 Q1-Q2
  - Validate on 2024 Q3-Q4
  - Deploy for Q4 2025

January 2026:
  - Retrain on 2006-2024
  - Validate on 2025
  - Deploy for 2026 Q1
```

**More frequent** but more complex.

---

### **Retraining Strategy - Option C: Rolling Window**

```
Always train on:
  - Most recent 10 years
  - Validate on most recent 1 year
  
October 2025:
  - Train: 2013-2023
  - Validate: 2024
  - Deploy: 2025
```

**Pros**: Adapts faster to changes  
**Cons**: Loses long-term patterns

---

### **My Recommendation: Option A (Annual)**

```
2025 Oct-Dec: Use current model (2006-2023 training)
              Paper trade, track results
              
2026 Jan 1:   Retrain on 2006-2024
              Validate on 2025
              Deploy new model for 2026
              
2027 Jan 1:   Retrain on 2006-2025
              Validate on 2026
              Deploy for 2027
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Simple schedule (once per year)
- ✅ Always have fresh holdout validation
- ✅ Enough training data (15+ years)
- ✅ Captures slow market evolution
- ✅ Not overfitting to recent noise

---

## 📅 **Your 2-Month Plan (Nov-Dec 2025)**

### **Week 1-2 (Late Oct): Setup**
```
1. Create production scoring script
2. Test on recent races (verify outputs)
3. Set up daily automation
4. Configure alerts/logging
```

### **Weeks 3-10 (Nov-Dec): Paper Trading**
```
1. Run scoring daily (no real money yet)
2. Log all signals to database
3. Track results vs predictions
4. Expected: ~160 bets total
5. Target: ROI > +2% to validate backtest
```

### **Jan 1, 2026: Decision Point**
```
If paper trading successful (ROI > +2%):
  ✅ Deploy with small real stakes (£10-20/bet)
  ✅ Continue for Q1 2026
  ✅ Retrain with 2024 data

If paper trading failed (ROI < 0%):
  ❌ Don't deploy real money
  🔍 Analyze why (calibration drift? Market changed?)
  🔄 Retune thresholds or try different approach
```
