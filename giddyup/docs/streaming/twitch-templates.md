## 🎬 Opening Script (What to Say):

```
Hey everyone! Welcome to the stream! 

Today we're running my automated horse racing betting bot LIVE. 

For those new here - I've built a Python bot that:
• Analyzes horse racing data
• Places bets automatically via Betfair API
• Tracks results in real-time from Sporting Life
• Posts everything to Telegram

Right now you're looking at [describe what's on screen]

We've got [X] races lined up today with a £5,000 bankroll.

The bot will:
- Place bets 60 minutes before each race
- Only bet if odds meet our threshold
- Post results 10 minutes after races finish
- Track P&L throughout the day

Should be exciting! Let's see how the algorithm performs!

Drop your predictions in chat! 🏇💰
