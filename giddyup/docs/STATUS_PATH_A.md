# Path A Implementation - Status Summary

**Date**: October 17, 2025 13:30 UTC  
**Branch**: `model_a`  
**Status**: ⏳ **Training in progress** (Fold 1/5)

---

## ✅ What We Built

### **1. Leakage Guards (NEW)**
**File**: `src/giddyup/data/guards.py`

```python
# Regex-based detection of market features
BANNED = re.compile(r"(odds|price|rank|fav|bsp|sp|ip|wap|traded|"
                    r"overround|market|official_rating|racing_post_rating|"
                    r"rpr|or\b)", re.IGNORECASE)

def assert_no_market_features(df_cols, feature_cols):
    # Fails immediately if market/expert features detected
    # Used before every training run
```

**Why**: Prevents OR/RPR from sneaking back into training.

---

### **2. Pure Ability Features (UPDATED)**
**File**: `src/giddyup/data/feature_lists.py`

**Removed** (5 features):
- ❌ `official_rating` (expert rating)
- ❌ `racing_post_rating` (expert rating)
- ❌ `best_rpr_last_3` (derived from expert rating)
- ❌ `gpr_minus_or` (delta from expert rating)
- ❌ `gpr_minus_rpr` (delta from expert rating)

**Kept** (23 features):
```python
ABILITY_FEATURES = [
    # Our own rating (independent)
    "gpr", "gpr_sigma",
    
    # Raw form
    "days_since_run", "last_pos", "avg_btn_last_3",
    "career_runs", "career_strike_rate",
    
    # Objective stats
    "trainer_sr_total", "trainer_wins_total", "trainer_runs_total",
    "jockey_sr_total", "jockey_wins_total", "jockey_runs_total",
    
    # Course/race context
    "runs_at_course", "wins_at_course",
    "field_size", "class_numeric", "is_flat", "is_aw",
    "dist_f", "draw", "age", "lbs",
]
```

### **3. Documentation**
- ✅ `PATH_A_PURE_ABILITY.md` - Complete Path A guide
- ✅ `METHOD.md` - Full methodology (13 sections)
- ✅ `FIX_LOOK_AHEAD_BIAS.md` - What went wrong before

## 📊 Training Progress (Live)

```
🏇 Path A Training - PURE ABILITY MODEL

Data:
  Train: 1,888,760 runners (2006-2023)
  Test:  189,346 runners (2024-2025)

Features: 23 (down from 28)
  ✅ NO official_rating
  ✅ NO racing_post_rating
  ✅ Guards passed

Current Status:
  Fold: 1/5
  Log Loss: 0.31 (starting)
  
Previous (with OR/RPR):
  Log Loss: 0.16 (unrealistically low)
  
✅ Higher log loss = GOOD!
   Model has to work harder without expert hints
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### **Metrics Comparison**

| Metric | Before (OR/RPR) | Path A (Expected) | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Features** | 28 | 23 | Removed expert ratings |
| **AUC** | 0.9558 | 0.60-0.75 | Independent of market ✅ |
| **Log Loss** | 0.1596 | 0.30-0.50 | Realistic uncertainty ✅ |
| **ROI (backtest)** | +268.8% | +3% to +10% | Actually achievable ✅ |
| **Edge** | Fake (leakage) | Real (independent) | Can deploy live ✅ |

---

## 🔍 Why This Works

### **Problem Before**
```
Model: p_win ≈ f(OR, RPR)
Market: Also knows OR and RPR
Result: Model ≈ Market → No edge
```

### **Solution Now**
```
Model: p_win ≈ f(GPR, form, trainer, jockey, course)
Market: Knows OR/RPR/volume
Result: Model ≠ Market → Find mispricing!
```

### **Value Betting**
```
Example:
  Our model:    18% win probability (fair odds: 5.56)
  Market odds:  8.0 (vig-free: 11.2%)
  
  Edge: 18% - 11.2% = 6.8pp
  EV:   +23.5% (after 2% commission)
  
  ✅ BET when edge > 4pp and EV > 3%
```

## ⏰ Timeline

### **Completed** (Last 3 hours)
- ✅ Created `guards.py` with regex detection
- ✅ Removed OR/RPR from ABILITY_FEATURES
- ✅ Updated `train_model.py` for Path A
- ✅ Deleted old dataset (had OR/RPR)
- ✅ Started training with 23 pure ability features
- ✅ Committed to `model_a` branch

### **In Progress** (~45 min remaining)
- ⏳ Training Fold 1/5 (current)
- ⏳ Training Folds 2-5
- ⏳ Isotonic calibration
- ⏳ Test set evaluation

### **Next** (After training completes)
1. **Check metrics**: AUC should be 0.60-0.75 (not 0.96!)
2. **Run backtest**: Use `backtest_simple.py` on 2024-2025
3. **Analyze results**:
   - ROI by odds band
   - Performance by GPR level
   - Monthly stability
4. **If positive edge** (ROI > +3%):
   - Register model as "path_a_v1"
   - Create scoring script
   - Paper trade for 1 month
5. **If no edge** (ROI ≤ 0%):
   - Review calibration
   - Check for remaining leakage
   - Try different filters

## 🔬 Validation Tests

### **Feature Safety** ✅
```bash
# All 23 features pass guard
✅ Guard passed: No market features detected
✅ No suspicious market keywords found

# Confirmed removed:
❌ official_rating
❌ racing_post_rating
❌ best_rpr_last_3
❌ gpr_minus_or
❌ gpr_minus_rpr
```

### **Point-in-Time GPR** ✅
```
2007 races: GPR from    87K runs (2006 only)
2010 races: GPR from   350K runs (2006-2009)
2023 races: GPR from 1,776K runs (2006-2022)
2024 races: GPR from 1,889K runs (2006-2023)
```
Each year uses ONLY past data.

### **Log Loss Increase** ✅
```
With OR/RPR:    0.16 (too low)
Without OR/RPR: 0.31 (realistic)

Higher loss = Model has no expert shortcuts
             = Must learn from raw data
             = Truly independent
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### **1. Expert Ratings ARE Market Proxies**

Official Rating and Racing Post Rating are created by experts who:
- Watch every race
- Analyze form thoroughly  
- Consider market expectations
- Adjust based on patterns

**Result**: OR/RPR ≈ expert consensus ≈ highly correlated with market

### **2. High AUC Can Be Deceptive**

- **AUC 0.96** looked amazing but meant model was learning market
- **AUC 0.70** looks worse but means independent assessment
- For value betting: **Independence > Accuracy**

### **3. The Goal is Mispricing, Not Prediction**

```
❌ WRONG: Try to predict winners better than market
✅ RIGHT: Find horses where our probability > market probability

We don't need to be right more often.
We need to be right when we DISAGREE with market.
```

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch

After training completes, check for:

| Red Flag | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| AUC > 0.85 | Still leaking | Review features again |
| Log Loss < 0.30 | Too confident | Check for data errors |
| ROI > +20% | Too good to be true | Likely still has leakage |
| Bets < 50 | Filters too tight | Relax thresholds |
| Avg odds < 4.0 | Betting favorites | Increase ODDS_MIN |

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Path A is successful if:

1. **AUC: 0.60-0.75** (independent)
2. **Log Loss: 0.30-0.50** (realistic)
3. **ROI: +3% to +10%** (after 2% commission)
4. **Bets: 500-2000** per year
5. **Avg Odds: 6-12** (not all favorites)
6. **CLV > 0** (beating closing line)

If all 6 criteria met → **Real edge detected** → Ready for paper trading!
