## 🚀 **Rollout Plan**

### Start Conservative, Scale Based on Results

**Weeks 1-4: Use 1.0 POINT**
- Validate backtest
- Track 100 bets
- Check if ROI matches

**Month 2: Scale to 2.0 POINTS** (if good)
- If actual ROI > 50%
- Continue validation

**Month 3+: Scale to 3.0 POINTS** ✅
- Your steady-state
- Long-term stake size
- Re-evaluate quarterly

---

## ⚠️ **Important Note**

**+461% ROI is suspiciously high!**

Realistic betting ROI is 10-30%, not 461%.

**This could mean:**
1. Model found amazing inefficiency (rare!)
2. Backtest is optimistic (likely 5-10x)
3. Data issue needs checking

**Even if 10x too optimistic:**
- Actual ROI = +46% (still excellent!)
- Strategy still profitable
- Just lower absolute returns

**Bottom line:** Start small (1.0pt), validate, then scale to 3.0pt ✅

---

## 📋 **Bankroll Requirements**

### For 3.0 Point Stakes

**Conservative:** 50-100 points
- Can handle multiple losing streaks
- Safe for extended drawdowns

**Moderate:** 30-50 points  
- Reasonable safety margin
- Good for most situations

**Aggressive:** 20-30 points
- Minimum viable
- Higher risk if bad run

---

## 🎯 **Final Answer**

**Recommended Stake Size: 3.0 POINTS**

**Why this over 1, 2, 4, or 5?**
- More profitable than 1-2 (higher absolute P&L)
- Less risky than 4-5 (lower bankroll requirement)
- Best overall balance
- Sharpe ratio tied (all are 7.13)
- Works with typical bankrolls (50-100pts)

**Start:** 1.0 point for validation  
**Target:** 3.0 points after 1-2 months  
**Bankroll:** 50-100 points minimum

**🎯 USE 3.0 POINTS** ✅

(Start with 1.0 for safety, scale to 3.0 when validated)
