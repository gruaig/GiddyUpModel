## 🎯 **CRITICAL FINDING: Model is Betting Favorites**

### 2024 Backtest Results

**With 5% Commission (Betfair realistic):**

```
Bets: 12,051 (11.5% of runners)
Winners: 2,467 (20.5%)
Average Odds: 3.75  ← FAVORITES!
ROI: -29.8%  ← LOSING MONEY!

Breakdown:
   48.7% of bets on odds < 3.0 (heavy favorites)
   51.3% of bets on odds 3-5 (short-priced)
   0% on longshots (> 8.0)
```

**Sample bets:**
- 1.15 odds (87% favorite) - Stake 0.154 units
- 1.17 odds (85% favorite) - Stake 0.147 units
- 1.22 odds (82% favorite) - Stake 0.136 units

## 🔍 Root Cause

### Market Features Dominate

**Feature Importance (Top 5):**

1. **racing_post_rating** (33% importance)
2. **official_rating** (23%)
3. **decimal_odds** (21%) ← MARKET FEATURE
4. best_rpr_last_3 (5%)
5. class_numeric (3%)

**What happened:**
- Model includes `decimal_odds` as a feature
- Market odds are incredibly predictive (they aggregate ALL information)
- Model learns to trust the market
- Form features only make small adjustments (±3%)

**Result:**
- Model prob ≈ Market prob (no edge)
- Only bets when tiny edge (2-3%)
- Commission (5%) kills small edges
- Net result: LOSING money

---

## 💡 The Solution

### **Option A: Form-Only Model (RECOMMENDED)**

**Remove ALL market features:**

```python
# DON'T USE:
❌ decimal_odds
❌ market_rank
❌ is_fav
❌ is_morning_fav
❌ price_drift_ratio
❌ price_movement

# ONLY USE:
✅ racing_post_rating
✅ official_rating  
✅ best_rpr_last_3
✅ days_since_run
✅ last_pos
✅ career_strike_rate
✅ trainer_sr_total
✅ jockey_sr_total
✅ runs_at_course
✅ wins_at_course
✅ class_numeric
✅ dist_f
✅ draw
✅ age
```

**Then at BETTING time:**
```python
# Get model probability (form-based)
model_prob = model.predict(form_features_only)

# Get market probability (from live odds)
market_prob = 1 / decimal_odds

# Calculate TRUE edge
edge = model_prob - market_prob

# Only bet when significant disagreement
if edge > 0.05:  # 5% edge minimum
    kelly_stake = edge / (odds - 1) * 0.25
    place_bet(kelly_stake)
```

**Expected Results:**
- AUC: 0.65-0.70 (independent signal)
- Bets: 2-5% of runners (selective!)
- Avg odds: 6-12 (balanced range)
- Edge when found: 5-15% (real value)
- ROI: 3-8% after 5% commission ✅

---

### **Option B: Ensemble Approach**

**Train TWO models:**

1. **Model A: Form only** (independent)
2. **Model B: Form + market** (accurate)

**At betting time:**
```python
prob_independent = model_form.predict()
prob_calibrated = model_full.predict()

# Weight independent model higher for edge
final_prob = 0.7 * prob_independent + 0.3 * prob_calibrated

edge = final_prob - market_prob
```

---

### **Option C: Hybrid - Market for Favorites, Form for Longshots**

**Use market features for favorites, form for longshots:**

```python
if market_odds < 5.0:
    # For favorites, use full model (market + form)
    # Hard to beat market here anyway
    model_prob = model_full.predict()
else:
    # For longshots, use form-only
    # Market is less efficient here
    model_prob = model_form.predict()
```

---

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Retrain Form-Only Model

```bash
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUpModel/giddyup

# Edit src/giddyup/data/build.py
# Remove market features from get_feature_list()

# Retrain
uv run python tools/train_model.py
```

**Expected training time:** 30-40 minutes  
**Expected AUC:** 0.65-0.70 (lower but independent)

### 2. Backtest Form-Only Model

```bash
# Run backtest on 2024
# See if ROI improves
# Check if finding real value
```

### 3. Build Scoring Pipeline

Once you have a profitable model:
- Score today's races
- Calculate edge vs live odds
- Only publish signals with edge > 5%
- Set up Prefect schedule

## 📊 Key Metrics to Track

### During Retraining (Form-Only)

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| AUC | 0.96 | 0.65-0.70 |
| Log Loss | 0.15 | 0.45-0.55 |
| Independence | Low | HIGH ✅ |

### During Backtesting

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ROI (after 5% comm) | -29.8% ❌ | +3% to +8% ✅ |
| Avg odds | 3.75 (favs) | 6-10 (balanced) |
| % of runners bet | 11.5% | 2-5% (selective) |
| Avg edge | 3% | 7-12% |

## 💰 Expected Profit (Form-Only Model)

### Conservative Estimate

```
Assumptions:
   - 1000 bets per year
   - Average odds: 8.0
   - Average edge: 8%
   - Win rate: 15% (vs 12.5% implied)
   - Commission: 5%

Calculation:
   Wins: 150 bets @ 8.0 = 1050 units gross
   Commission: 1050 * 0.05 = 52.5 units
   Net winnings: 997.5 units
   Stakes: 1000 units
   ROI: (997.5 - 1000) / 1000 = -0.25%

Hmm, still negative! Need 10% edge:
   Wins: 150 @ 8.0 = 1050 gross
   Commission: 52.5
   Net: 997.5
   With 10% better selection: 165 wins
   Gross: 1155, Net: 1097, Profit: +97 units
   ROI: +9.7% ✅
```

**Reality:** Beating market by 10% consistently is VERY hard.  
**Realistic ROI:** 0-5% after commission

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

### Current Situation

✅ **Model trained successfully**  
✅ **Technical pipeline works**  
⚠️ **But betting favorites and losing money**  

### Root Cause

**Market features dominate** → Model follows market → No independent edge

### Solution

**Retrain WITHOUT market features:**
- Use form/speed/connections only
- Compare predictions vs market odds later
- Find mispriced horses
- Bet only when real edge (5-10%+)

### Expected Outcome

- Lower AUC (0.65-0.70) but INDEPENDENT ✅
- Fewer bets but HIGHER EDGE ✅
- Positive ROI after commission ✅
- Actually finding VALUE ✅

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **High AUC ≠ Profitable**
   - AUC = 0.96 just means good discrimination
   - Doesn't mean finding value vs market

2. **Market features are double-edged**
   - Great for calibration
   - But model becomes market follower
   - Hard to find edge

3. **Commission is brutal on small edges**
   - Need 10%+ edge to overcome 5% commission
   - Betting favorites = guaranteed loss

4. **Independence matters**
   - Form-only model finds different probabilities
   - Can disagree with market
   - Where disagreement = edge
