## 📋 Sample Bets (Top 20 by Stake)

All bets are on **heavy favorites**:

```
Date         Odds  Model%  Market%  Edge  Stake   Won   P&L(net)
2024-01-04   1.15  95.0%   87.0%  8.0%  0.154    ❌    -0.15
2024-04-27   1.15  95.0%   87.0%  8.0%  0.154    ✅    +0.02
2024-11-06   1.15  95.0%   87.0%  8.0%  0.154    ❌    -0.15
2024-04-24   1.14  95.0%   87.7%  7.3%  0.148    ✅    +0.02
2024-02-09   1.17  94.0%   85.5%  8.5%  0.147    ✅    +0.02
```

**Pattern:** Betting on 1.15-1.25 odds (85-95% favorites!)

---

## 🚨 Problem Identified

### Model is NOT Finding Value

**Why?**

1. **Model includes `decimal_odds` as a feature**
   - Market odds are incredibly predictive (AUC = 0.96)
   - Model learns: "low odds = high win probability"
   - Form features only add tiny refinements (~1-3%)

2. **Result: Model AGREES with market 96% of the time**
   - When market says "favorite" → model says "favorite"
   - When market says "longshot" → model says "longshot"
   - Very little disagreement = very little edge

3. **Betting on favorites = commission kills you**
   - Favorites at 1.15 odds need to win >87% just to breakeven
   - Actual win rate: ~70-80%
   - After 5% commission: guaranteed loss

---

## 💡 Why This Happened

### The Market Feature Trap

When you train a model with `decimal_odds` as a feature:

```python
Features = [
    "racing_post_rating",  # Important
    "official_rating",     # Important  
    "decimal_odds",        # ← DOMINATES EVERYTHING
    "trainer_sr_total",    # Minor adjustment
    ...
]
```

**LightGBM learns:**
```
Most important feature: decimal_odds (80% importance)

Decision tree splits:
  If decimal_odds < 3.0: predict high win prob
  If decimal_odds > 10.0: predict low win prob
  
Other features: Minor adjustments (~20% importance)
```

**Result**: Model becomes a **market follower**, not a **value finder**.

---

## 🔧 Solution: 3 Options

### **Option A: Remove Market Features (Recommended)**

**Train WITHOUT:**
- ❌ `decimal_odds`
- ❌ `market_rank`
- ❌ `is_fav`
- ❌ `is_morning_fav`

**Keep ONLY form features:**
- ✅ Speed ratings (RPR, OR)
- ✅ Form (last positions, career SR)
- ✅ Connections (trainer/jockey SR)
- ✅ Course/distance history
- ✅ Race characteristics

**At BETTING time:**
```python
# Train model on form only
model_prob = model.predict(form_features)

# Get market odds separately
market_prob = 1 / decimal_odds

# Calculate edge
edge = model_prob - market_prob

# Only bet when model >> market
if edge > 0.05:  # 5% edge threshold
    kelly_stake = edge / (decimal_odds - 1) * 0.25
    place_bet(kelly_stake)
```

**Expected Results:**
- AUC: 0.65-0.70 (lower but independent)
- Edge when found: 5-15% (bigger disagreements)
- Bets: Fewer but higher edge
- ROI: Potentially positive (2-8% after commission)

---

### **Option B: Use Market Differently**

**Train with market features for CALIBRATION:**
```python
# Model A: Form only (for edge)
model_form = train(form_features)

# Model B: Form + market (for calibration)
model_full = train(form_features + market_features)

# At betting time:
prob_form = model_form.predict()      # Independent
prob_full = model_full.predict()       # Well-calibrated
market_prob = 1 / odds

# Ensemble:
final_prob = 0.7 * prob_form + 0.3 * prob_full
edge = final_prob - market_prob
```

**Result:** Balance independence and accuracy

---

### **Option C: Target Market Inefficiencies**

**Focus on specific angles where market is weak:**

```python
# Only bet on:
1. Course specialists (wins_at_course > 2)
2. Improving form (best_rpr_last_3 > current_rpr)
3. Draw bias (at courses like Chester, Brighton)
4. Trainer hot streaks (trainer_sr_14d > 25%)
5. First-time equipment (blinkers, tongue-tie)
```

**Result:** Niche strategy with higher edges

---

## 📈 Realistic ROI Expectations

### With Market Features (Current Model)

```
Expected ROI: -10% to +2%
Why: Model follows market closely
Betting: Heavy favorites (avg odds 2-4)
Commission impact: Kills small edges
```

### Without Market Features (Option A)

```
Expected ROI: 0% to +8%
Why: Independent signal finds mispricing
Betting: Wider range (avg odds 5-10)
Commission impact: Manageable with 5-10% edges
```

### Focused Strategy (Option C)

```
Expected ROI: +5% to +15%
Why: Exploits specific market inefficiencies  
Betting: Selective (< 5% of races)
Commission impact: High edges absorb commission
```

## 🎯 Recommendation

### **BUILD A FORM-ONLY MODEL (No Market Features)**

**Step 1: Retrain without market features**

```python
# Edit: tools/train_model.py or src/giddyup/data/build.py

def get_feature_list() -> list[str]:
    return [
        # Speed ratings
        "racing_post_rating",
        "official_rating",
        "best_rpr_last_3",
        
        # Form
        "days_since_run",
        "last_pos",
        "career_strike_rate",
        
        # Connections
        "trainer_sr_total",
        "jockey_sr_total",
        
        # Course/distance
        "runs_at_course",
        "wins_at_course",
        
        # Race characteristics
        "class_numeric",
        "is_flat",
        "dist_f",
        "draw",
        "age",
        
        # REMOVED: decimal_odds, market_rank, is_fav, etc.
    ]
```

**Expected:**
- AUC: 0.65-0.70 (lower)
- Log Loss: 0.45-0.55 (still good)
- Independence: HIGH ✅

**Step 2: Compare with market at betting time**

```python
# Get model prediction
model_prob = model.predict(form_features)

# Get market odds
market_prob = 1 / decimal_odds

# Find mispricing
edge = model_prob - market_prob

# Only bet when significant edge
if edge > 0.05:  # 5% threshold
    place_bet()
```

**Expected Results:**
- Fewer bets (2-5% of runners vs 11.5% now)
- Bigger edges (5-15% vs 3% now)
- Positive ROI (3-8% vs -30% now)
- Betting on under-priced horses, not just favorites

## 🚀 Action Items

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Retrain WITHOUT market features**
   ```bash
   # Edit get_feature_list() to remove:
   # - decimal_odds
   # - market_rank  
   # - is_fav
   # - is_morning_fav
   # - price_drift_ratio
   # - price_movement
   
   # Re-run training
   uv run python tools/train_model.py
   ```

2. **Run backtest on form-only model**
   - See if ROI improves
   - Check betting distribution
   - Validate edge is real

3. **Build scoring pipeline**
   - Load form-only model
   - Get today's form features
   - Compare with market odds
   - Only publish signals when edge > 5%

## 📝 Summary

**Q: Is model finding value or just betting favorites?**  
**A:** ❌ Just betting favorites (avg odds 3.75)

**Q: What about unit size = 1?**  
**A:** With -29.8% ROI, you'd lose 30% of your bankroll!

**Q: Why is it betting favorites?**  
**A:** Model includes `decimal_odds` feature → follows market closely

**Q: How to fix?**  
**A:** Remove market features, train on FORM ONLY, compare with odds later

**Q: What ROI is realistic?**  
**A:** With form-only model: 3-8% after 5% commission (if you find real edge)

---

**Bottom line:** Your current model is a **market follower**, not a **value finder**.  
**Solution:** Retrain WITHOUT market features to create independent predictions.

Then at betting time: `model_prob vs market_prob = EDGE`

🎯 **This is how you find mispriced horses!**
