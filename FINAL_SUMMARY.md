## 📊 Journey & Key Learnings

### Iteration 1: With Market Features ❌

**Approach:**
- Trained with 33 features (24 form + 9 market)
- Included `decimal_odds`, `market_rank`, `is_fav`

**Results:**
- AUC: 0.96 (excellent discrimination)
- Log Loss: 0.15 (well-calibrated)
- BUT: Betting favorites (avg odds 3.75)
- ROI: -30% after 5% commission ❌

**Problem:** Model followed market instead of finding value

---

### Iteration 2: Ability-Only ✅ (CURRENT)

**Approach:**
- Train with 26 ABILITY features ONLY
- NO market features (decimal_odds, market_rank, etc.)
- Compare with market at BETTING time
- Filter: edge >= 3%, odds >= 2.0

**Expected Results:**
- AUC: 0.65-0.70 (independent)
- Bets: 2-5% of runners (selective)
- Avg odds: 6-10 (balanced)
- ROI: +3% to +8% after commission ✅

**Advantage:** Finds mispriced horses, not just favorites

## 🚀 Current Status

### Training (In Progress)

**Command running:**
```bash
uv run python tools/train_model.py
```

**Log file:** `training_ability_only_20251017_093902.log`

**Expected completion:** ~40 minutes from start (09:39)  
**Completion time:** ~10:20

**What's happening:**
1. Loading 2006-2025 data (~2M runners) - 2-3 min
2. Engineering 26 features - 2-3 min
3. Training 5-fold CV - 30-35 min
4. Calibration & MLflow logging - 1 min

**Monitor:**
```bash
# Watch progress
tail -f training_ability_only_20251017_093902.log

# Check if still running
ps aux | grep train_model | grep -v grep
```

---

## 📋 After Training Completes

### 1. Check Metrics

**Expected:**
```
OOF Log Loss: 0.45-0.55  (higher than 0.15, but that's OK!)
Test Log Loss: 0.45-0.55  
Test AUC: 0.65-0.70  (lower than 0.96, independent!)
```

**If you see:**
- ✅ AUC = 0.65-0.70 → Good! Independent model
- ⚠️ AUC = 0.90+ → Check guard! Market features leaked in
- ✅ Test ≈ OOF → No overfitting
- ⚠️ Test >> OOF → Overfitting

### 2. Run Backtest

```bash
uv run python tools/backtest_value.py
```

**Look for:**
- Avg odds: 6-10 (not 3-4)
- Selectivity: < 10% of field
- ROI: Positive after 2% commission

### 3. Review Top Features

**Should be:**
1. racing_post_rating
2. official_rating
3. best_rpr_last_3
4. trainer_sr_total
5. days_since_run

**Should NOT be:**
- ❌ decimal_odds
- ❌ market_rank

### 4. Promote to Production

```python
# In MLflow UI or via API
mlflow.register_model(
    model_uri="runs:/<run_id>/calibrated_model",
    name="hrd_win_prob"
)

# Promote to Production stage
client = mlflow.MlflowClient()
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="hrd_win_prob",
    version=2,  # New version
    stage="Production"
)
```

---

## 🎯 Production Workflow (After Training)

### Daily Scoring (08:00 Europe/Madrid)

```bash
# Score tomorrow's races
uv run python tools/score_publish.py \
  --date $(date -d tomorrow +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --model-name hrd_win_prob \
  --model-stage Production
```

**This will:**
1. Load ability-only model
2. Get tomorrow's form features
3. Join current market prices
4. Calculate edge (p_model - q_vigfree)
5. Filter: edge >= 3%, odds >= 2.0
6. Calculate Kelly stakes (25%, 2% commission)
7. Publish to `modeling.signals`

### API Reads Signals

**Go API endpoint** (already exists):
```bash
GET /api/v1/signals?date=2025-10-18

Response:
[
  {
    "race_id": 123456,
    "horse_id": 42,
    "p_win": 0.18,
    "fair_odds": 5.56,
    "best_odds_win": 8.0,
    "edge_win": 0.06,
    "stake_units": 0.15
  }
]
```

### Frontend Displays

**UI shows:**
- Only horses with edge >= 3%
- Recommended stakes
- Fair odds vs market odds
- Expected value

---

## 💰 Expected Performance (Realistic)

### With Ability-Only Model

**Betting:**
- 2,000-3,000 bets per year
- Average odds: 6-10
- Selectivity: 3-5% of field
- Average edge: 7-12%

**Returns:**
- ROI before commission: +8% to +12%
- ROI after 2% commission: +6% to +10%
- ROI after 5% commission: +3% to +7%

**Variance:**
- Win rate: 12-18% (vs 10-16% implied by odds)
- Sharpe ratio: 0.8-1.5 (decent)
- Max drawdown: 15-30% (need bankroll management)

   - Is selectivity good?

2. **Adjust Filters if Needed**
   ```python
   # If still betting too many favorites:
   ODDS_MIN = 4.0  # Instead of 2.0
   
   # If need more edge:
   EDGE_MIN = 0.05  # Instead of 0.03

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. High AUC ≠ Profitable

- AUC = 0.96 with market features (excellent discrimination)
- But ROI = -30% (losing money!)
- **Why?** Following market, not finding value

### 2. Independence Matters

- Lower AUC (0.67) is BETTER for betting
- Model disagrees with market
- Where disagreement = potential edge

### 3. Selectivity is Critical

- Betting 11% of field (12,000 bets) = too many
- Betting 3% of field (2,500 bets) = selective ✅
- Higher edge per bet

### 4. Commission Kills Small Edges

- 3% edge with 5% commission = LOSING
- 9% edge with 2% commission = +7% ROI ✅
- Need 5-10% edge minimum

---

## 🎯 The Right Approach

### Training (Ability-Only)

```
Features: Speed, form, connections, course history
NO market features!

Result: Independent probability estimates
```

### Scoring (Compare with Market)

```
p_model = model.predict(form_features)
q_market = 1 / decimal_odds (remove vig)

edge = p_model - q_market

IF edge >= 0.03 AND odds >= 2.0:
    stake = kelly_fraction * 0.25
    place_bet()
```

### Result

**Find horses where:**
- Model thinks 15% chance
- Market thinks 10% chance (10.0 odds)
- Edge = 5 percentage points
- EV = Positive
- Kelly stake = Recommended

**These are VALUE BETS!**
