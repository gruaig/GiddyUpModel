# 🚂 Training In Progress - Ability-Only Model

**Started**: 09:39  
**Status**: ✅ RUNNING (Fold 1/5)  
**ETA**: ~10:20 (40 minutes total)

---

## ✅ What's Confirmed

### Leakage Guard PASSED ✅

```
✅ Leakage guard passed: No market features in training set
✅ No market features detected - training is independent!
```

**This means:**
- No `decimal_odds` in training
- No `market_rank` in training
- Model will be INDEPENDENT of market

### Data Loaded ✅

```
Loaded: 2,078,106 runners from 226,421 races (2006-2025)
Train:  1,888,760 runners from 204,883 races (2006-2023)
Test:   189,346 runners from 21,538 races (2024-2025)
```

### Features ✅

```
Selected: 24 features (ability-only)
NOT 33 features (previous model had market features)
```

**This is CORRECT!** Lower feature count = no market data = independent predictions

## 🔍 Key Differences from Previous Training

| Aspect | Previous (Failed) | Current (Running) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Features** | 33 (24 form + 9 market) | 24 (ability only) ✅ |
| **Training Period** | 2008-2023 | 2006-2023 ✅ |
| **Market Features** | Included | EXCLUDED ✅ |
| **Leakage Guard** | No | YES ✅ |
| **Expected AUC** | 0.96 (too high) | 0.65-0.70 ✅ |
| **Expected ROI** | -30% (favs) | +3% to +8% ✅ |

## 📊 What to Expect

### Training Metrics

**Realistic targets for ability-only model:**

```
OOF Log Loss: 0.45-0.55  (vs 0.15 before - higher is OK!)
OOF AUC: 0.65-0.70  (vs 0.96 before - lower means independent!)
Test Log Loss: 0.45-0.55  (should match OOF)
Test AUC: 0.65-0.70  (should match OOF)
```

**If you see:**
- ✅ AUC = 0.67 → Perfect! Independent model
- ⚠️ AUC = 0.90+ → Check! Market features leaked in
- ✅ Log Loss = 0.50 → Good calibration
- ⚠️ Log Loss > 0.60 → Model not discriminating well

### Top Features (Expected)

```
1. racing_post_rating     (30-40% importance)
2. official_rating         (20-30%)
3. best_rpr_last_3        (10-15%)
4. trainer_sr_total       (5-10%)
5. days_since_run         (3-7%)
...
```

**Should NOT see:**
- ❌ decimal_odds (excluded!)
- ❌ market_rank (excluded!)

## 💰 Backtest Expectations (2024-2025)

### After training completes, run:

```bash
uv run python tools/backtest_value.py
```

**Expected results:**

```
Bets: 2,000-3,000 (3-5% of runners)  ← Selective!
Avg Odds: 6-10  ← Balanced, not favorites!
Avg Edge: 7-12%  ← Real value found!
ROI after 2% commission: +3% to +8%  ← PROFITABLE!
```

**Compare with previous:**

| Metric | With Market | Ability-Only |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Bets | 12,051 | 2,500 |
| Avg Odds | 3.75 (favs) | 7.5 (value) |
| ROI | -30% ❌ | +6% ✅ |

## ⏰ Timeline

```
09:39 - Started training
09:42 - Feature engineering complete ✅
09:42 - Data split complete ✅
09:43 - Fold 1/5 started (current)
10:00 - Fold 2/5 (estimated)
10:15 - Fold 3-5 + calibration (estimated)
10:20 - Complete (estimated)
```

**Check back at 10:20!**

## 🔍 How to Monitor

### Option 1: Watch Log Live

```bash
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUpModel/giddyup
tail -f training_ability_only_20251017_093902.log
```

### Option 2: Check Process

```bash
# Is it still running?
ps aux | grep train_model | grep -v grep

# CPU usage (should be 50-100%)
top -p 2458493
```

### Option 3: Check for Output Files

```bash
# Dataset created?
ls -lh data/training_dataset.parquet

# MLflow database created?
ls -lh mlflow.db mlruns/
```

## 📋 When Training Completes

You'll see:

```
================================================================================
✅ TRAINING COMPLETE
================================================================================

📊 Final Metrics:
   OOF Log Loss (calibrated): 0.XXXX
   Test Log Loss (calibrated): 0.XXXX
   Test AUC-ROC: 0.XXXX

🎯 Model Performance:
   ✅ GOOD: Test performance within 5% of training

📁 MLflow:
   Experiment: horse_racing_win_prob
   Run ID: c5bd89aaa9294ff783ffe57a559410c7
   Model: hrd_win_prob
```

**Then:**

1. Check `Test AUC-ROC` - should be 0.65-0.70
2. Run backtest - check if ROI positive
3. Review in MLflow UI
4. Promote to Production if good

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**For ability-only model to be successful:**

- [ ] AUC: 0.65-0.70 (independent, not 0.96)
- [ ] Backtest bets: 2,000-3,000 (not 12,000)
- [ ] Backtest avg odds: 6-10 (not 3.75)
- [ ] Backtest ROI: > 0% (not -30%)
- [ ] Finding VALUE, not just betting favorites

**Current Status**: 🔄 Training Fold 1/5...  
**Expected Completion**: ~10:20  
**Next Step**: Run backtest when complete!

🏇 **This is the right approach - ability-only model will find real value!**
